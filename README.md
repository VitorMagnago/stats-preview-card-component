## My process

Another challenge similar to the previous ones but this time I tried to use new things I'm learning, like improving semantic HTML5 markup, CSS Grid, advanced selectors, custom Properties and Mobile-first workflow.

I had a little trouble on the desktop version scaling the image correctly, so I had to put a very large breakpoint.
